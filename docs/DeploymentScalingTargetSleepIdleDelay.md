## Example

```python
from koyeb.models.deployment_scaling_target_sleep_idle_delay import DeploymentScalingTargetSleepIdleDelay

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of DeploymentScalingTargetSleepIdleDelay from a JSON string
deployment_scaling_target_sleep_idle_delay_instance = DeploymentScalingTargetSleepIdleDelay.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(DeploymentScalingTargetSleepIdleDelay.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
deployment_scaling_target_sleep_idle_delay_dict = deployment_scaling_target_sleep_idle_delay_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of DeploymentScalingTargetSleepIdleDelay from a dict
deployment_scaling_target_sleep_idle_delay_from_dict = DeploymentScalingTargetSleepIdleDelay.from_dict(deployment_scaling_target_sleep_idle_delay_dict)
